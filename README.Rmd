R scripts to process/cleanup data from the repo: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19 into tidy datasets[^tidypaper]

[^tidypaper]: "Tidy Data" H. Wickham, https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v059i10

**Last updated on** `r format(lubridate::now(tzone = "UTC"), "%F %T %Z")`

**Data source commit reference**: [`r latest_commit_sha`](`r latest_commit_url`) 

*Notes*

  - For the cases, I've used the filename to to get the timestamp, because that is more reliable
  - **2020-02-14**: the original data source has changed its data structure, the timeseries data is empty as of the commit referred below.
  - **2020-02-27**: changed code to reflect changes in source data files.
  - **2020-03-04**: added Continents and ISO-3 country codes, using the `countrycode` R package.
  - **2020-03-05**: 
	- Latitude and longitude information started appearing in cases files in March, used that to add that information the rest of the cases.
	- Added code to tidy the WHO situation report timeseries
  - **2020-03-12**: source data no longer has the classification "Others" for locations not corresponding to countries (i.e. Cruise Ships), so the code has been modified to account for that change.
